## Data Science Project

Requirements to take this course:
- Basic understanding of probability and statistics
- HTML, JS and CSS *
- REST APIs: XML and JSON *
- SQL queries *
- Office Excel (or similar spreadsheet software)

\* so basically: strong full stack developer skills

Things you will learn during the course:
- Python3 (probably Jupyter Notebook or Anaconda dist.)
- Python3 libraries used for data scraping and processing (NumPy, ScraPy, NLTK, Pandas, etc.)
- Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval (NLTK)
- Regular Expressions *r'/\bdon\'t\swor+y\b/'*
- Data cleaning and processing, modelling pitfalls
- Basic analytical and machine learning methods (Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, TF/IDF, etc.)
- Popular free databases

The first few weeks will consist of mostly going through learning materials and excercises. 
Machine learning models will be thaught at the end of the course, based on how much time we have left.

**At the end of the course you will be able to make an Amazon Alexa skill together, that implements either a basic search engine or a reocmmendation system using voice commands.**

## Curriculum
- Start the first week with [learning Python](python.md)
- 2nd week we will connect [to different REST APIs](api.md)
- 3rd week we will [scrape websites](crawler.md)
- 4th week we will learn [basic NLP](nlp.md)

After the first 4 weeks, you will know how to write code that allows you to get basically any kind of readable data from the internet. 

## Quesitons and answers
You can reach us on slack or on social media. If you need additional learning materials on certain subjects, let us know!
